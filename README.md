## üìÑ Research Overview  

This repository collects high-level concepts, visualizations, and papers related to **AI-driven security research** and **PsyOps frameworks**.  
The goal is to provide **structured insights** into how adversarial actors might exploit modern AI systems and hybrid infrastructures, while maintaining an **academic and conceptual framing**.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: No sensitive exploits, real-world payloads, or operational details are included. All materials are **abstracted, obfuscated, and purely conceptual**.
